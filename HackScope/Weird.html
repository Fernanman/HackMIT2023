    <h1>Ahem.</h1>
    <h2 style="color: blue">
      What did you just say about me, you little whiner? I’ll have you know I
      graduated top of my class at MIT, and I’ve been involved in numerous
      secret hacks on the Great Dome, and I have over <u>300</u> confirmed
      psets. I am trained in cyberwarfare and I’m the top competitive programmer
      in the entire CS department.
    </h2>
    <h1 style="color: red">
      <em> You are nothing to me but just another target. </em>
    </h1>
    <h2>
      I will wipe you with precision the likes of which has never been seen
      before on this Earth, mark my words. You think you can get away with
      contacting me over the Internet? Think again, buddy. As we speak I am
      contacting my secret network of hackers across campus and your IP is being
      traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, buddy. The storm
      that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your internet
      connection. It's over, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can infect
      your computer in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my mind.
      Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed coding, but I have access to
      the entire arsenal of the United States National Security Agency and I
      will use it to its full extent to wipe you off the face of the continent.
      If only you could have known what retribution your little “clever” idea
      was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have thought twice. But
      you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price. I will rain
      fury all over you and you will drown in it.
    </h2>
