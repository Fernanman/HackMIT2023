I actually didn't solve this during the puzzle window, but instead kept thinking about the puzzle and completed it after.
The two parts are puzzles, the first in 2 dimensions and the second in 10, which make the second considerably harder. Though
after knowing that there are 10 dimensions, you know there are basically at most 20 possible moves that can be done (positive and negative
for each axis). Knowing all the possible moves, it's pretty easy to just DFS the routes and find the last number.

Kinda sad I didn't figure out the puzzle was in 10 dimensions, but oh well.
